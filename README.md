💡 About the Simulator

The Taiwan Strait Conflict Simulator is an interactive tool designed to explore the factors that might influence Xi Jinping’s decision-making process regarding Taiwan.

By combining data-driven insights and customizable indicators, this simulator offers a dynamic way to understand how variables like regime stability, nationalism, and power balance could shape the future of the Taiwan Strait.

📊 How the Simulator Works

	•	Realistic Indicators: Adjust key factors like US-China power balance, nationalism pressure, and regime stability.
	•	Weighted Scoring: Each factor is influenced by historical and current trends, with a final score representing the likelihood of conflict.
	•	Critical Threshold: A score above 7 means war is “likely.”

🕒 Default Scenario:
The simulator uses 2024 as the starting point but allows you to model potential shifts in policies and events up to 2035.

🔍 Why This Matters

This project isn’t just about predictions—it’s about starting conversations on:
	•	The delicate balance of power in the Taiwan Strait.
	•	How data and technology can enhance geopolitical analysis.
	•	What these scenarios mean for global security and the future of Taiwan.

🎯 Why I Built This

This simulator combines my passions for:
	•	Geopolitics: Understanding the subtle forces driving world events.
	•	Web Development: Building tools that are both interactive and insightful.
	•	Scenario Planning: Using creative methods to model and discuss possible futures.

It’s a work in progress, but this project is a personal milestone for me, blending technical skills with a deep interest in shaping meaningful conversations.
