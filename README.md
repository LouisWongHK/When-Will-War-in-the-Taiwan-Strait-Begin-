🇨🇳 Taiwan Strait Conflict Simulator

Project Overview

The Taiwan Strait Conflict Simulator is an interactive tool designed to model potential geopolitical and military conflicts in the Taiwan Strait.

With this simulator, you can:
	•	Explore the possible trajectories of cross-strait tensions.
	•	Analyze how decisions impact outcomes of war or peace.
	•	Create custom scenarios to simulate complex, multi-variable situations.

Whether you are a researcher, a geopolitical enthusiast, or a strategy game lover, this simulator offers a unique experience for understanding one of the world’s most pressing conflict zones.

### *📊 How the Simulator Works*  

Adjust factors like *US-China Power Balance* and *Nationalism Pressure* to simulate various scenarios.  

### *🔍 Why This Matters*  

This isn’t just about predictions—it’s about understanding the future of Taiwan and global security.

💡 About the Simulator

The Taiwan Strait Conflict Simulator is an interactive tool designed to explore the factors that might influence Xi Jinping’s decision-making process regarding Taiwan.

By combining data-driven insights and customizable indicators, this simulator offers a dynamic way to understand how variables like regime stability, nationalism, and power balance could shape the future of the Taiwan Strait.

📊 How the Simulator Works

	•	Realistic Indicators: Adjust key factors like US-China power balance, nationalism pressure, and regime stability.
	•	Weighted Scoring: Each factor is influenced by historical and current trends, with a final score representing the likelihood of conflict.
	•	Critical Threshold: A score above 7 means war is “likely.”

🕒 Default Scenario:
The simulator uses 2024 as the starting point but allows you to model potential shifts in policies and events up to 2035.

🔍 Why This Matters

This project isn’t just about predictions—it’s about starting conversations on:
	•	The delicate balance of power in the Taiwan Strait.
	•	How data and technology can enhance geopolitical analysis.
	•	What these scenarios mean for global security and the future of Taiwan.

🎯 Why I Built This

This simulator combines my passions for:
	•	Geopolitics: Understanding the subtle forces driving world events.
	•	Web Development: Building tools that are both interactive and insightful.
	•	Scenario Planning: Using creative methods to model and discuss possible futures.

It’s a work in progress, but this project is a personal milestone for me, blending technical skills with a deep interest in shaping meaningful conversations.
